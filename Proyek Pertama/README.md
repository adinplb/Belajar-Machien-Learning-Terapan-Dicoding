1. Why the problem must be resolved? <br>


2. How resolved the problem? <br>
Interactive image processing techniques, along with a linear programming based inductive classifier, have been used to creeate a highly accurate systm for diagnosis of Breast Tumors. A small fraction of a Fine Needle Aspirate Slide (FNA) is selected and digitized. The digitized image of a FNA of a Breast mass describe chracteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Those are computed and become features for this research. So we could possibily diagnosed whether it is Malignet or Benign through Nuclear Feature Extraction.

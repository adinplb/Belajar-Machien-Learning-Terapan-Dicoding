1. Issue Focus? <br>
The significant advances in cancer research over the past decades has been carried out with the advent of new technologies in the field of medicine. Scientists have conducted a new approach with different methods for the early prediction of cancer treatment outcome particularly Breast Cancer. One of the example approaches applied is the growing trend on Machine Learning Techniques. However, a common problem in several research is the lack of external validation or testing regarding the predictive performance of their models. 

2. Why does the issue need to be resolved? <br>


3. How to address the issue? <br>
Interactive image processing techniques, along with a linear programming based inductive classifier, have been used to creeate a highly accurate systm for diagnosis of Breast Tumors. A small fraction of a Fine Needle Aspirate Slide (FNA) is selected and digitized. The digitized image of a FNA of a Breast mass describe chracteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Those are computed and become features for this research. So we could possibily diagnosed whether it is Malignet or Benign through Nuclear Feature Extraction.
